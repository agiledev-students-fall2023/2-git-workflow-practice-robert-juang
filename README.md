## Scalable folder structure for react apps:

This is a cool way to structure your react applications which are scalable. Since the tech industry move so fast, designing your react app in this format is helpful so you run into less trouble later on. A guide is provided explaining variable naming, api, error handling, security, state management, and much more. It's a good introduction to building large scale react applications and I would love to use and explore this format more in the future.
